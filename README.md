# Kaboomers
A balatro mod that introduces the `Flaming` card type and 4 new jokers (and some other stuff)!

## New features
![Flaming](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/Flaming.png?raw=true)
## The flaming card type!
- Flaming is a card enhancement which can be put on a card through the `Explosive` tarot card, finding it through standard packs, playing on the `Flammable Deck`, or playing the `Burnt` challenge.
- It adds `+5 mult`, with that number increasing by 1 for every time it is played without being destroyed
- Every time the card is played, it has a 1/8 chance (can be affected by the Joker `Oops! All 6s` and the vouchers listed below) to be destroyed.
- All of the new jokers act when any action occurs on the flaming type

## Jokers!
In this mod, there are 4 new jokers based off of the Kaboomer character from [this roblox game I made](https://www.roblox.com/games/13146174045/Kaboom-Kompetition), each one of them interfaces with the new Flammable card type in some way

### Red Kaboomer
![Red Kaboomer](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/red.png?raw=true)
This is the only legendary that this mod adds. Every time a `Flaming` card is destroyed, this joker will gain X1 mult, meaning the Xmult increases by one for each card destroyed. You can find this joker from a 1 in 5 chance from a `Soul Card`, a vanilla feature for summoning legendaries, along with by default in the Kabooming challenge.

### Blue Kaboomer
![Blue Kaboomer](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/blue.png?raw=true)
This is the only rare joker that this mod adds. Every time a `Flaming` card is destroyed, this joker will gain +50 chips, meaning the +Chips increases by 50 for each card destroyed. This joker will appear regularly in the shop alongside other rare jokers.

### Yellow Kaboomer
![Yellow Kaboomer](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/yellow.png?raw=true)
This is one of the two uncommon jokers that this mod adds. Every time a `Flaming` card is destroyed, this joker will gain +$1, which will be distributed once the round has ended, meaning the money amount increases by 1 for each card destroyed. This joker will appear regularly in the shop alongside other uncommon jokers.

### Green Kaboomer
![Green Kaboomer](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/green.png?raw=true)
Oh. It's you.

This is one of the two uncommon jokers that this mod adds. Every time a `Flaming` card is played, it has a `1 in 4` chance to retrigger it 2 additional times (can be affected by `Oops! All 6s!`). This joker will appear regularly in the shop alongside other uncommon jokers.

We do not like Green Kaboomer.
## Consumables!
![Explosive Tarot Card](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/explosive.png?raw=true)
There is only one additional consumable, and it is the `Explosive` tarot card for creating Flaming playing cards. Designed by @NeverrMoon himself. It can enhance up to 2 selected cards into `Flaming Cards`

## Vouchers!
![Gasoline](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/gasoline.png?raw=true)![Fire Extinguisher](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/fire_extinguisher.png?raw=true)
There are 2 new vouchers, each does something with Flaming cards. One will reduce the chance for flaming cards to be destroyed, and the other will increase it. This is to give a diverged playstyle, where choosing the increased one will help upgrade the kaboomers, and the one to keep them will help everyone else.

## Deck backs!
![Flammable](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/flammable_deck.png?raw=true)
There is only one new deck back, and it is called the `Explosive deck`! Every card has a 1/4 chance to be flaming when the game starts.
> yes, the icon is the background for the jokers, I'm lazy.

## Challenges
Last but not least, there are 2 new challenges for you to play

### Kabooming
![Kabooming Challenge](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/kabooming.png?raw=true)
This challenge starts you off with a `Red Kaboomer` joker, but restricts you to only 2 joker slots. There are many ways to beat this challenge, but I'll let you figure that out :)

### Burnt
![Burnt Challenge](https://github.com/29cmb/Kaboomers/blob/main/docs/burnt.png?raw=true)
This challenge is very simple. Every single card in your deck is flaming with nothing else special about it. You'll need to play carefully, since the 1/8 chance for destruction is always looming.
